## Lisa

Mother leaves when she's 2
Father goes to jail when she's 6

#### Foster Care
Lisa is in foster care from age 6 through 9
Len adopts her when she's 9
She goes into foster care again when she's 16 through 18 (technically)

#### Pregnancy
When Len goes to jail, she's 16. She runs away from foster care to live with her boyfriend. Gets pregnant, gives birth, gives the child up for adoption. She does not tell Len. Len will not discover that she had a child for another 16 years (2012).

## 1979
Lewis returns from jail
Len's mother disappears
Len's mom's parents own the house we see in LoT s01e03 (Hadley Ave), so they kick Lewis and Len out. 
Lewis takes Len on jobs (small hands)

## 1984
Len's grandfather dies. With no adults to rely on, and with a 4 year old to take care of, Len becomes vulnerable to a former colleague of Lewis. He's a cop, but also a bad man.

Len thinks the guy genuinely cares for him. He continues to think that into his early twenties. The relationship ends when Len goes to juvie.

## 1988
Len gets out of juvie and files for emancipation. Conditions of early release depend on probation and having a job. Len gets a low wage job and experiences [wage theft](https://www.epi.org/publication/wage-theft-bigger-problem-forms-theft-workers/) 

> Wage theft—employers’ failure to pay workers money they are legally entitled to—affects far more people than more well-known and feared forms of theft such as bank robberies, convenience store robberies, street and highway robberies, and gas station robberies. Employers steal billions of dollars from their employees each year by working them off [the clock](http://www.latimes.com/business/money/la-fi-mo-wage-theft-survey-fast-food-20140331,0,4674874.story#ixzz2xdfna48O), by failing to pay [the minimum wage](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/20140325minimumwageandwomenreportfinal.pdf), or by cheating them of [overtime pay](https://www.epi.org/publication/updating-overtime-rules-important-step-giving/) they have a right to receive.

> In 2012, there were 292,074 robberies of all kinds, including bank robberies, residential robberies, convenience store and gas station robberies, and street robberies. The total value of the property taken in those crimes was $340,850,358. By contrast, the total amount _recovered_ for the victims of wage theft who retained private lawyers or complained to federal or state agencies was at least $933 million in 2012. This is almost three times greater than all the money stolen in robberies that year. Further, the nearly $1 billion successfully reclaimed by workers is only the tip of the wage-theft iceberg, since most victims never sue and never complain to the government.

## 1996

Lisa goes into foster care
Lisa runs away 
Lisa gets pregnant
